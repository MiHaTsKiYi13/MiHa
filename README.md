This **Windows Tweaker** batch file is a multifunctional script designed to enhance system performance, clean up unnecessary files, and configure various settings 
on a Windows operating system. Below is a detailed description of the script's functions:

### 1. **Create a System Restore Point**
   - The script starts by asking the user if they want to create a system restore point before proceeding with any changes. This is useful in case the user wants to revert to a previous system state in the event of any issues after running the script.

### 2. **Main Menu**
   - The main menu provides four options:
     1. **System Cleanup** — Cleans up various unnecessary files and clears caches.
     2. **System Optimization** — Applies different tweaks to improve system performance.
     3. **System Information** — Displays system information (this part is incomplete in the script).
     4. **Exit** — Exits the script.

### 3. **System Cleanup Section**
   In this section, the script performs several cleanup tasks:
   - Removes temporary files (`%temp%`), system files, and update files.
   - Clears image caches, thumbnails, and system logs.
   - Empties the Recycle Bin and recent files history.
   - Cleans up browser caches (for Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
   - Clears font and memory caches.
   - Flushing DNS and deleting memory dumps.
   - Removes unnecessary Windows apps (e.g., 3D Builder, Calculator, Weather).

### 4. **System Optimization Section**
   This section applies performance enhancements by:
   - Disabling unwanted Windows services, such as indexing and telemetry.
   - Enabling some performance tweaks like turning off Windows animations, reducing background processes, and configuring power settings for optimal performance.

### 5. **Summary**
   - The script provides a quick and efficient way to clean and optimize a Windows system, removing bloatware, clearing out old files, and improving system speed.
   - It helps to declutter the system by eliminating unnecessary files and applications that can slow down performance.

Overall, this **Windows Tweaker** is aimed at users who want to quickly enhance and maintain their Windows systems without having to manually adjust individual settings.
